2. File Transfer Server

Send and receive files between a client and server.

Implement chunked sending and checksum verification.

Optional: add encryption using XOR or a simple custom cipher.

Skills honed: stream I/O, binary file handling, protocol design.

Server Side
- FTS functions the same as HTTP server
- storage for photo using vector
- convert Photo(png, jpeg, bmp) into binary
- send the copy of the binary photo

client
- converts the copy of binary back into a photo



admin  <--->  File transer server <-----> client
- admin is the only one that can save photos to the server
- client can only request copies of photos
- after client connects to the server, the server should show the client the list of photos for the client to pick from
- after a client/admin connects, they should send a message about their role(ROLE:ADMIN, ROLE:CLIENT);
