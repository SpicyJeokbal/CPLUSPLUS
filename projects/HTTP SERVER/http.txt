HTTP SERVER FUNCTION

- listens on a port
    - create a socket
    - bind it to an IP + port (0.0.0.0:80808)
    - mark it as listening to port

- accept client connection
    - wait for an incoming connection
    - when client connects, accept it and get a new socket for communication

- receives http request
    - read raw bytes from client socket
    - http requests are plain text, 
        e.g. 
            GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
            Host: localhost:8080
    - parse at least the first line(method, path, protocol)        

- send http response
    - build a valid http response string:
            HTTP/1.1 200 OK
            Content-Type: text/html
            Content-Length: <length>

            <html>...</html>
    - send it back to client socket
    - close the client connection

    #include <winsock2.h>
        WSAStartup()  -  MUST CALL ONCE
        socket() - create a socket
        bind() - bind to an IP/port
        listen() - mark socket as passive (waiting for connections)
        accept() - accept a client connection
        connect() - for clients (not server side)
        send() / recv() - data transfer
        closesocket() - cleanup
        WSACleanup()   -   MUST CALL BEFORE EXIT

        sockaddr_in, sockaddr_in6 (IPv4/IPv6 structs)
        inet_pton() / inet_ntop() - convert between strings and binary IPs
