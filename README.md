## Introduction

C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system/software development, game development, and performance-critical applications. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of examples and exercises to help you understand the core concepts of C++.

## Features

- Examples of basic and advanced C++ concepts
- Data structures and algorithms implemented in C++
- Practical exercises to reinforce learning
- Clear and concise explanations of each topic

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Arrays**: Examples and exercises related to arrays.
- **Classes**: Understanding classes and object-oriented programming.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures.
- **Data Types**: Overview of different data types in C++.
- **Enums**: Usage of enumerations in C++.
- **ForEachLoop**: Examples of using the for-each loop.
- **Functions**: Understanding functions and their usage.
- **Multidimensional Arrays**: Working with multidimensional arrays.
- **Pointers**: Introduction to pointers and memory management.
- **References**: Understanding references in C++.
- **Strings**: Working with string manipulation.
- **Struct**: Using structures in C++.
- **Switch**: Examples of switch-case statements.
- **Ternary Operator**: Usage of the ternary operator.
- **Errors**: Common errors and how to handle them.
- **Header Guard**: Understanding header guards in C++.
- **Problems**: A collection of programming problems to solve.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SpicyJeokbal/CPLUSPLUS.git



## Libraries to learn
1. Crypto++
Use for: Encryption, decryption, hashing, signatures, etc.

Why it's good: Massive, battle-tested, supports most modern algorithms.

Get started: https://www.cryptopp.com/

2. OpenSSL (C library but works with C++)
Use for: TLS/SSL, encryption, certificates.

Why it's good: Industry standard, real-world applications use it.

Note: You'll use the C API with C++ wrappers.

3. Libpcap / WinPcap / Npcap
Use for: Packet sniffing and network traffic capture.

Why it's good: Itâ€™s what Wireshark uses. Build your own packet sniffer.

Note: WinPcap is outdated; use Npcap on Windows now.

4. Boost.Asio
Use for: Network socket programming (TCP/UDP).

Why it's good: Needed for creating servers/clients, port scanners, etc.

5. POCO C++ Libraries
Use for: Networking, HTTP(S), file handling, threading, etc.

Why it's good: Helps when you're writing tools that talk to the web or manage system stuff.

6. z3 Solver (from Microsoft)
Use for: Binary analysis, reverse engineering tools, symbolic execution.

Why it's good: Used in advanced analysis (CTF level stuff).


## Final project

   Keylogger (educational only, stay ethical!)

   Port scanner (like a mini nmap)

   Packet sniffer (using libpcap)

   Simple XOR/RSA/AES encryptor-decryptor
   
   Brute-force cracker for hashes (just to understand hashing)
